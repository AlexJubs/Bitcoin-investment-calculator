# Bitcoin-investment-calculator
WiE Google Hackathon Project - An investment calculator WebApp made with AngularJS.


The user inputs the amount of money they are willing to invest and the calculator returns an amount that the user could potentially profit depending on the sale prices.

The user is able to choose which currency they would like to invest in, and the appropriate rate it fetched from the API. 

The current rate of bitcoin is retreived using the BitPay API.
